# Hey there, My name is Josh!

### I've been a live sound engineer, a barista, lived as a missionary for a few years, was a musician, a translator/interpreter, a CNC machine operator, and currently I am a part-time mailman... 

### You can say that I've been through many job titles but was not able to find a career path that I found enriching and fulfilling.

### UNTIL NOW!

I am currently 

- studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- getting acquainted with git and github. 
- trying to establish a firm foundation in order to create a presentable portfolio. 
- looking forward to building a career as a front-end web developer. 

### So please, stay tuned! I will be updating my profile on a regular basis as I get more and more acquainted with the world of web development.
